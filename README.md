# C â€“ Core Infrastructure

This repository consolidates core software components into a single, manageable codebase, designed for high-velocity development and robust automation.

### Core Principles

*   **Integrated Environment:** A single `pyproject.toml` manages all Python dependencies, ensuring a consistent development and testing environment across all components.
*   **Cohesive Versioning:** Cross-cutting changes to the library and applications are captured in a single commit, eliminating dependency conflicts and ensuring the entire system is always in a deployable state.
*   **Automated Workflow:** On every push to `main`, the CI/CD pipeline automatically lints, tests, and deploys updated components, including the static site to GitHub Pages.

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TechEliteAutomation/c.git
    cd c
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment:**
    Copy the example configuration file and edit it with your local paths and API keys.
    ```bash
    cp config.example.toml config.toml
    nano config.toml
    ```
