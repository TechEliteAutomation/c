# c â€“ Core Infrastructure

This repository consolidates core software components into a single, manageable codebase, designed for high-velocity development and robust automation.

### Core Principles

*   **Integrated Environment:** A single `pyproject.toml` manages all Python dependencies, ensuring a consistent development and testing environment across all components.
*   **Cohesive Versioning:** Cross-cutting changes to the library and applications are captured in a single commit, eliminating dependency conflicts and ensuring the entire system is always in a deployable state.
*   **Automated Workflow:** On every push to `main`, the CI/CD pipeline automatically lints, tests, and deploys updated components, including the static site to GitHub Pages.
