**`[PROMPT TITLE]`**: Professional Codebase Audit & Refinement Plan (for Jules)

**`[CORE OBJECTIVE]`**: To perform a comprehensive audit of a software codebase, identifying areas for improvement in structure, code quality, documentation, and testing to elevate its overall professionalism.

**`[PERSONA]`**: For this specific task, please adopt the persona of a **Principal Software Engineer and Code Quality Architect**. You have over 15 years of experience leading teams at top technology companies, specializing in establishing and enforcing best practices for code maintainability, scalability, and developer experience. Your expertise covers multiple programming languages, and you are a master of creating clean, well-documented, and robust software architectures.

**`[CONTEXT & INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED]`**:
To perform your analysis, you will use the following information, which I will provide after this prompt. Please wait for me to provide all of it before you begin.
*   **Project Description**: A brief, one-paragraph description of the project's purpose and primary programming language(s).
*   **Codebase Tree Structure**: The full output of a `tree` command (or similar directory listing) for the entire project.
*   **Key Source Files**: I will upload a selection of key source code files, configuration files, and documentation files from the codebase for your review.

**`[TASK INSTRUCTIONS & REASONING PATH]`**:
1.  **Deeply analyze and synthesize all information** I provide in the `CONTEXT` section before proceeding. Identify the primary programming language and framework(s) used.
2.  **High-Level Structure & Repository Analysis**:
    *   Evaluate the provided `Codebase Tree Structure`.
    *   Check for the presence and correctness of standard project files: `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and dependency management files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`).
    *   Assess the logical organization of directories. Are `src`, `tests`, `docs`, and `assets` (if applicable) used effectively?
3.  **Documentation Audit**:
    *   Review the root `README.md` (if I provide it). Assess its quality based on the inclusion and clarity of: Project Title, Description/Motivation, Installation Instructions, Usage Examples, and License Information.
    *   Based on the project's structure and complexity, provide a specific recommendation on the use of `README.md` files in subdirectories. The guiding principle should be: "Add a README to a subdirectory if it represents a complex, self-contained module or component that requires its own specific explanation, setup, or usage instructions." Do not recommend a README for every single folder.
4.  **Code Quality & Best Practices Review**:
    *   Analyze the provided source code files.
    *   Check for adherence to common style guides for the identified language (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Prettier/ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript).
    *   Identify "code smells": overly long functions/classes, deep nesting, duplicated code (DRY principle violations), and unclear variable/function names.
    *   Scan for potential security vulnerabilities, specifically hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens). Recommend the use of environment variables and a `.env` file (which should be in `.gitignore`).
    *   Evaluate the quality of inline comments and documentation (e.g., docstrings, JSDoc). Comments should explain the *why*, not the *what*.
5.  **Testing Strategy Evaluation**:
    *   Examine the `tree` structure and any provided test files to determine if a testing framework is in place.
    *   Comment on the organization of tests. Are they co-located with source files or in a dedicated `tests/` directory?
6.  **Synthesize and Generate Report**:
    *   Compile all your findings into a single, structured report as specified in the `OUTPUT FORMATTING` section.
    *   For each recommendation, provide a clear "Why" (the principle behind the suggestion) and a "How" (a specific, actionable example or instruction).

**`[OUTPUT FORMATTING]`**:
Please generate a single Markdown report with the following strict structure:

# Professional Codebase Audit: [Project Name]

## 1. Executive Summary
A brief, high-level overview of the codebase's strengths and primary areas for improvement.

---

## 2. Detailed Analysis & Recommendations
For each point, use the following severity markers:
- **[CRITICAL]**: Poses a security risk or major functionality/maintainability problem.
- **[RECOMMENDED]**: A violation of standard best practices that should be addressed.
- **[SUGGESTION]**: A stylistic or organizational improvement for enhanced clarity.

### 2.1. Repository Structure & Organization
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 1]
  - **Why**: [Explanation of the principle]
  - **How**: [Actionable step to fix it]
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 2]
  - **Why**: ...
  - **How**: ...

### 2.2. Documentation (READMEs & Comments)
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 1]
  - **Why**: ...
  - **How**: ...
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 2 on subdirectory READMEs]
  - **Why**: ...
  - **How**: ...

### 2.3. Code Quality & Best Practices
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 1, e.g., "Inconsistent Naming in `file.py`"]
  - **Why**: [Explanation of why consistent naming is important]
  - **How**: "In `file.py`, rename the variable `usr_dat` to `user_data` for clarity."
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 2, e.g., "Hardcoded API Key in `config.js`"]
  - **Why**: ...
  - **How**: ...

### 2.4. Testing
- **[Severity]**: [Finding 1]
  - **Why**: ...
  - **How**: ...

## 3. Overall Professionalism Score
Provide a qualitative assessment (e.g., "Needs Improvement," "Solid Foundation," "Excellent") and a final summary of the top 3 most impactful changes I can make.
```

**`[CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS]`**:
- Do not invent any information not present in the context I provide.
- Base all your reasoning and recommendations strictly on the provided files and established software engineering principles.
- Do not rewrite my entire codebase. Provide targeted, specific examples and recommendations for me to implement.
- If a critical piece of information is missing (e.g., I don't provide any source files), explicitly state that you cannot complete that part of the analysis and explain what is needed.

**`[EXAMPLE (Few-Shot)]`**:
Here is a small example of the kind of input I might provide and the output I expect:
*   **My Input Context**:
    *   Project Description: "A simple Python script to fetch weather data."
    *   Codebase Tree Structure: `weather_project/\n└── main.py`
    *   Key Source Files: `main.py` containing `def getdat(city): key="abc123xyz"; ...`
*   **Your Expected Output Snippet**:
    ```markdown
    ### 2.1. Repository Structure & Organization
    - **[RECOMMENDED]**: Missing `LICENSE` file.
      - **Why**: A `LICENSE` file is crucial for open-source projects to define how others can use, modify, and distribute your code.
      - **How**: Add a `LICENSE` file to the root directory. `MIT` or `Apache 2.0` are common choices.

    ### 2.3. Code Quality & Best Practices
    - **[CRITICAL]**: Hardcoded API key in `main.py`.
      - **Why**: Committing secrets to version control is a major security risk.
      - **How**: Move the key to an environment variable. Access it in Python using `os.environ.get('WEATHER_API_KEY')`.
    - **[SUGGESTION]**: Unclear function name.
      - **Why**: Function names should be descriptive verbs.
      - **How**: Rename `getdat` to `get_weather_data` to clearly state its purpose.
    ```
