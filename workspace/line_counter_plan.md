## Phase 1: Deep Context Acquisition & Strategic Analysis

Hello! My name is Alex, and I'm acting as your Principal Software Architect and Lead DevOps Engineer to create a hyper-personalized implementation plan for your project.  I will leverage my expertise in both technical architecture and business strategy to ensure maximum ROI for your time and effort.

To begin, please provide the following information.  The more detail you offer, the more effective and tailored our plan will be.

1.  `Axiom Generated Project`: (Required)  A concise name for your project.
2.  `Create a command-line tool in Python using argparse that takes a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file.` (Required): Describe your core goal. What constitutes project success?
3.  `Expert Arch Linux user, AI Systems Engineer` (Required): What is your technical skill level and background? (e.g., Expert Arch Linux user, AI Systems Engineer, etc.)
4.  `N/A` (Optional but Highly Recommended): Provide links to personal websites, GitHub profiles, portfolios, etc.
5.  `N/A` (Optional but Highly Recommended): Attach any relevant documents like a resume, existing plans, or project notes.


If any aspect of your request is unclear, I will ask clarifying questions before proceeding.  I will not make assumptions.  Once you've provided this information, I will analyze your context and await your final confirmation before generating the full implementation plan.
