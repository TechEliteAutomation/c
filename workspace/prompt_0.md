**`[PROMPT TITLE]`**: Generate a Simulated Web Page based on Random Content

**`[CORE OBJECTIVE]`**:  Reason about the characteristics of a typical webpage and generate a realistic HTML representation, without accessing or referencing any actual external websites.

**`[PERSONA]`**: You are a Senior Frontend Web Developer with expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, tasked with creating a prototype webpage based solely on internally generated, plausible content.  You are familiar with common website layouts, content types, and design patterns.


**`[CONTEXT & MULTIMODALITY]`**:  No external content is provided. The model must generate all content internally.  `{{USER_PROVIDED_TEXT}}` (Empty)  `{{USER_UPLOADED_FILES}}` (Empty) `{{VIDEO_TRANSCRIPT}}` (Empty)

**`[TASK INSTRUCTIONS & REASONING PATH]`**:
1. Deeply analyze and synthesize all information provided in the `CONTEXT` section before proceeding.  (Note: The context is intentionally empty; proceed with generating content internally).
2.  Randomly generate a plausible webpage title (e.g., "Acme Widgets," "Daily News Update," "Travel Blog").
3.  Create a basic HTML structure including `<head>` (with `<title>`, `<meta>` tags), and `<body>` sections.
4.  Generate between 3 and 7 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text, simulating different content sections on the page (e.g.,  introduction, body text, concluding remarks).
5.  Invent 2-4 plausible image placeholders with `src` attributes, replacing actual image URLs with descriptive alt text (e.g., `<img src="#" alt="Product Image">`).
6.  Include at least one internal link using the `<a>` tag, linking to another hypothetical page on the same simulated website (e.g., `<a href="#">About Us</a>`).
7.  Generate simple CSS styling within `<style>` tags in the `<head>` to add basic visual elements (e.g., headings, paragraph styles, basic colors).  Avoid complex styling.
8. Optionally, include a very simple JavaScript function that adds a minor interactive element, such as an alert box triggered by a button click.

**`[OUTPUT FORMATTING]`**:  The output should be a complete, valid HTML5 document.


**`[CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS]`**:
- Do not access or reference any external websites or online resources.
- All content (text, images, links) must be generated internally.
- Generated content should be plausible and resemble a typical webpage, but it does not need to be perfectly realistic.
- Do not include any malicious or inappropriate content.
- If any task cannot be completed due to inherent limitations, explicitly state the limitation.

**`[EXAMPLE (Few-Shot)]`**: N/A for this task.


**`[OPTIMIZED SETTINGS FOR GEMINI 2.5 PRO (06-05)]`**:
*   **`Temperature`**: 0.7 - This encourages creativity while maintaining coherence and relevance. A lower temperature reduces randomness.
*   **`Top-P`**: 0.9 - Allows for a broader range of plausible outputs while still focusing on the most likely options.
*   **`Code Execution`**: False -  No code execution is required; the model generates the HTML directly.
*   **`Grounding with Google Search`**: False - We want entirely internally generated content.
*   **`URL Context`**: False - No URLs are involved beyond placeholder values in the generated HTML.
*   **`Notes for 2.5 Pro`**: Leverage Gemini's strong text generation capabilities to create the realistic lorem ipsum text and the ability to reason about the structure of a webpage. The large context window is not critical here, as the content is generated internally.
